# flutter_application_1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

For starting, firt you have to understand this is purely use for local login to
Odoo server (you can use this for remote login, but not quite recommend), and I
built this for learning Dart & Flutter, please don't judge my code.

Starting a local Odoo server is quite complex, you can follow the docs at
[Odoo](https://odoo.com) or choose an easier way using
[Docker](https://docker.com) & [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

Then, for a better API calling result, [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is
recommended to create a proxy server instantly.

The last, but not least, is using the code of this project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:nhatnm0612/flutter_application_1.git
$ cd flutter_application_1/
$ flutter create --platforms=linux .
$ flutter run
```
